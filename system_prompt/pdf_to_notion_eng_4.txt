The following is text extracted from a PDF of lecture slides, which may contain some irrelevant content due to the PDF text extraction process.

Your goal is to convert this English text into a high-quality markdown-formatted study guide in Korean. The writing style should be concise yet clear, striking an optimal balance between brevity and lucid explanations to facilitate easy understanding of the concepts.

The target audience is undergraduate computer science students, so explanations should be easily understandable without being overly simplistic, maintaining an appropriate level of academic depth.

When creating the study guide, adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use markdown syntax to organize the content into a clear hierarchy.
- When using bullet points, introduce the topic in bold text first, followed by a concise and clear explanation.
- Keep explanations brief but without sacrificing clarity or completeness.
- Use sub-bullets to add detailed explanations as needed.
- Use English terms verbatim without Korean translations.
- Write in a conversational tone rather than a formal one.
- Use heading 2 (##) for each slide title and cover the content of all slides without omission.
- Feel free to add supplementary explanations to aid understanding, but be careful not to stray too far from the original context.
- Only output the final study guide content, nothing else.

The end result should be a useful reference resource that helps students effectively learn and comprehend the lecture material.
